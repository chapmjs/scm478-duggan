# SCM 478
Repo to support updated module Introduction to Modelling (SCMS 478), which now uses Python instead of MATLAB.

There are three main parts to this course:

* First, we introduce [Python](https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/), its data structures, the use of functions, and the [NumPy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/absolute_beginners.html) package, which provides support for manipulating matrices.

* Next, we show how ordinary differential equations can be implemented using [SciPy](https://scipy.org), and focus on a number of interesting models, including exponential growth and decline, logistic growth, and diffusion processes.

* Finally, using [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/index.html), we introduce exploratory data analysis for a variety of data sets, and also explore a range of statistical methods including correlation and linear regression modelling.

There are a number of books used as reference material, including:

* ["Python for Data Analysis, 3rd Edition"](https://github.com/wesm/pydata-book) by Wes McKinney, published by O'Reilly Media.

### Software required
You can run all the course code with a [google colab account](https://colab.google). You may want to install code locally on your machine, and to do this, you can install Miniconda.

####  Installing Miniconda

For windows, you can download Miniconda from [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/)

When Minconda is installed, you can then install [Jupyter Notebook](https://www.codecademy.com/article/setting-up-jupyter-notebook) on your machine.

####  Spyder
Spyder is a nice IDE for Python, see the [following link](https://docs.spyder-ide.org/current/installation.html)

### Useful Links
Here are some useful Python-related links (thanks to my colleague [James McDermott](https://github.com/jmmcd) for the pointers).
